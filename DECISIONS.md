# Decisions

Why this theme is built the way it is. Each entry records something that was **not**
obvious from the design source and would otherwise be re-derived — or reverted by
accident — on the next pass or the next theme.

Grouped by area. "Measured" means the figure came from a DOM measurement or a pixel
diff against the rendered original, not from an estimate.

---

## Type and rendering

**Request the `opsz` axis explicitly when loading a variable font.**
`astro.config.mjs` asks for Newsreader with `options.experimental.variableAxis`. Without
it Google serves an instance pinned to its default optical size, which renders about 5%
wider and breaks every line. Measured: the same string is 594.12px in both builds once
the axis is requested.

**Preflight's `line-height: 1.5` is reset to `normal` on `html`, and the built-in
font-size/line-height pairings are cleared.**
The design source never sets a page line-height; leaving Preflight's would inflate every
UI and meta element that has no explicit leading. Affected 123 elements before the fix.

**Never apply Tailwind's `antialiased` utility.**
It forces `-webkit-font-smoothing: antialiased`, which thins every stem on macOS. The
source leaves smoothing at the browser default. Measured: it cost ~15% of the ink in a
Newsreader headline (37.79 vs 43.41) and roughly a point of pixel identity on _every_
page. Removing it lifted the whole build — `/post-01` 98.53% → 99.74%, `/styleguide`
98.64% → 99.52%.

**Mono leading is pinned with `--leading-mono: 1.31`, and the rule sets `--tw-leading`
as well as `line-height`.**
Only needed because mono is a system stack (see below). Chrome quantises `normal`
per size for IBM Plex Mono — 12.5 / 14 / 14.5 / 15 / 16 / 16.5 / 17px at 10–13px — so no
single constant is exact; 1.31 is the best fit across the sizes this theme uses.
Setting only `line-height` is not enough: size utilities compile to
`line-height: var(--tw-leading, …)` in the utilities layer and beat a base-layer rule.

> **If a theme actually loads its mono face, drop this pin entirely** — it exists to
> normalise a substitute, and would fight a real font.

**Glyphs the UI font lacks (← → ▾) are pinned to `system-ui, sans-serif`.**
Archivo has no arrows, so the source falls through to `system-ui`. Our chain reaches
Astro's metric-matched Arial fallback first, which changes both the advance width
(80.56 → 81.91px on a "Visit →" button) and the line box (37.5 vs 38.5px on pagination).
Pinning restores the source's own metrics exactly.

## Fonts

**Exactly two families, self-hosted through the Astro Fonts API.**
Newsreader (display + body, variable 300–600, roman + italic) and Archivo (UI + meta,
400/500/600/700). No runtime request to Google.

**IBM Plex Sans and IBM Plex Mono are deliberately not loaded**, though the source
references them; `--font-mono` is a system stack. This is the single largest source of
residual pixel drift in this theme — see the noise floor below.

---

## Content and data

**Tier chips read "Basic" and "Pro".** The source ships "Paid" and "Members". Changed at
the client's request; `TIER_LABELS` in `data/posts.ts` is the only place it lives.

**Each template keeps its own data file** — `posts.ts`, `archive.ts`, `tagArchive.ts`,
`authorArchive.ts` — rather than deriving one from another. The sources genuinely differ:
the blog ships six posts the homepage does not, and tags one shared post differently.
Deriving would bury that.

**Body copy still says "The Quarry" although the chrome says "Mirror".**
Prose transcribed from the design source is demo content; the site name, logo, titles and
© line are chrome. Renaming the copy would drift those pages from their originals for no
gain.

---

## Navigation and links

**One canonical `NAV` in `data/navigation.ts`; pages pass `current` and nothing else.**
The source ships a different nav per template. Unifying costs a little fidelity in the
header band — measured 0.03–0.05 points per page, confined to the header — and buys a
theme that behaves like a real site. `NavKey` is a union type, so a typo is a build error.

**Content links point at real routes, and post links follow membership state.**
`postHref(locked)` sends public posts to `/post-01` and members-only posts to
`/post-01-paywalled`, so the tier chips mean something. Tag chips → `/tags-single-01`,
bylines → `/author-single-01`.

**These stay inert on purpose:** pagination (there is no page two), the recommendation
links (`#recs` — third-party publications with fictional domains), footer RSS (`#` —
Ghost serves `/rss/` at runtime), and Privacy/Terms.

**The nav dropdowns are a preview aid, not the shipping nav.**
`NavDropdown` turns `NAV` into a variant browser so all 27 routes are one hover away
during review. A shipping theme deletes the `NavDropdown` call and renders the same
labels as plain links. Same for `FormStateSwitch` and the `?state=` query on the auth
pages.

---

## Components

**Presentational components are shared; domain components are not.**
`PostListRow`, `PostGridCard`, `PageIntro` and `CenteredIntro` are used by several
templates through props. Cards that genuinely differ per template (home, blog, tags,
authors) stay separate — matching the repo's existing pattern rather than growing one
component with a dozen flags.

**`Header` has three variants** — `site` (page header), `demo` (the styleguide specimen)
and `auth` (sign-in/up). The auth pages have no footer at all; their `<main>` flexes to
fill the viewport, which is what centres the card.

### Preflight traps that have bitten this build

- `a { text-decoration: inherit }` — links the source leaves underlined come out plain.
  Affects the author "Latest —" link and the About contact email; both carry an explicit
  `underline`.
- List markers are stripped — the About page's beats list needs `list-disc pl-6` back.
- `margin: 0` on everything breaks a native `<dialog>`'s own centring; it needs `m-auto`.

---

## Interactivity

**Alpine stores** hold what more than one component reads: `theme` (dark class +
localStorage) and `nav` (which menu is open — one at a time, with a 200ms grace period so
a diagonal move to a lower item doesn't lose it).

**Every state is server-rendered and toggled with `x-show`.** The auth forms' four
states, the FAQ answers and the search results are real markup, so they are searchable
and survive with JavaScript off. Closed items carry `x-cloak` so nothing flashes open.

**`$root`, not `$el`, inside an `Alpine.data()` method.** `$el` resolves to whichever
element the expression is running on — the input, or the close button — while `$root` is
the component's own element. This silently broke focus return in the header search.

**Search** is an inline header field over an index built at compile time from every demo
post (`data/search.ts`, 35 entries). The button carries `data-ghost-search` and
`openSearch()` bails if `#sodo-search` exists, so Ghost's own search takes over on a real
install without the two fighting.

## Verification

**Compare rendered-to-rendered.** The reference PNGs are a sanity check, not the target:
score the build against the _original HTML rendered through the same pipeline_, with the
design tool's chrome bar hidden by injected CSS and `px()` rewritten to local images.
Scoring the original against the PNGs gives the noise floor for the run.

**Accepted noise floor, ≈1–1.5%.** Three causes, all understood, none worth chasing:

| cause                                             | typical size                          |
| :------------------------------------------------ | :------------------------------------ |
| mono substitution (system stack vs IBM Plex Mono) | 0.25px per chip, 0.09px per 11px line |
| photo resampling at a sub-pixel offset            | up to 9% of a detailed image's pixels |
| glyph antialiasing on serif text                  | 3–5% of a text-dense band             |

Investigate a page only if it falls below ~98.5%.

**Two traps in the headless harness:**

- `ui-monospace` resolves to a different face in headless Chrome than in a real browser,
  so mono-heavy pages drift there in the _opposite_ direction from reality. Trust the DOM
  measurements taken in a real browser.
- `requestAnimationFrame` callbacks do not fire in the automated tab. Never build
  behaviour on rAF, and never verify with it.

**A 200 response is not proof a page rendered.** Three separate incidents shipped an
empty body behind a 200 — a component prop that was destructured but never defined, and
twice a missing import. Assert a byte floor and a clean dev log, not just the status.

**Restart the dev server after adding a page.** Tailwind's Vite plugin does not always
rescan a brand-new file, so arbitrary values silently fail to generate. `pnpm build`
scans from scratch, so this is a dev-only trap.

## Fonts are committed, not fetched

The Fonts API was doing its job — Google-hosted files, downloaded at build, served
from our own origin. It was swapped for woff2 committed under `public/fonts/` so the
faces live with the repo and the build has no network dependency at all.

**Newsreader had to stay variable.** The obvious version of this change — drop in the
per-weight static files Google's download button hands you — is wrong. Those instances
are pinned to a single optical size (`Newsreader 9pt`), and the whole reason the old
config requested the `opsz` axis was that a pinned instance renders ~5% wider than the
design source. The files here are the variable font pulled from the `css2` endpoint with
`opsz` requested, roman **and** italic, carrying `wght 200–800` and `opsz 6–72`. Italic
is not optional: eleven components set `italic` on `font-body`/`font-display`
(standfirsts, author bios, member quotes, 404-02), and a synthesized oblique on a serif
is visibly wrong.

`font-weight: 300 600` is declared even though the binaries go to 800 — that is the
range the Fonts API declared, so `font-bold` clamps to 600 exactly as it did before.
Widening it is a visual change, not a cleanup.

Newsreader keeps Google's `latin` / `latin-ext` / `vietnamese` split with `unicode-range`,
so a reader who never hits those glyphs never downloads those files. Archivo is
per-weight static — the design only uses 400/500/600/700, and there is no optical-size
axis to lose.

**What was given up:** Astro's metric-matched fallback faces. `font-display: swap` now
falls back to plain Georgia / system-ui, so first paint reflows slightly. Worth it for a
build with no font fetch; add `size-adjust`/`ascent-override` faces if CLS shows up.

**Two things that bite here:** `<link rel="preload" as="font">` without `crossorigin`
downloads the file twice. And a `@font-face` pointing at a missing file fails silently —
the page just renders in the fallback. Check filenames in `fonts.css` against
`public/fonts/` both directions; today it is 24 and 24.
